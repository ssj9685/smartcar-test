This is the starter kit for Server-Side Rendering with Express and Smartcar.

This kit contains a simple web application that displays car information using Smartcar's Node SDK and Express.

## Instructions
Before we get started, create an application on Smartcar's Developer Dashboard to get your API keys.

**Note:** On the dashboard, you will want to set your `redirect_uri` as `http://localhost:8000/exchange`.

To install the required dependencies and run this Express app -
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
